<h1> PTP-FS-INT-009 - PO Dispatch via cXML:  </h1>

<p>
Purchase orders will be transmitted to vendors electronically using the cXML standard using standard PO output functionality. The PO message output will trigger the generation of an IDOC that will be sent to the middleware system. For this purpose, Partner Profile (WE20) is set for each vendor (Outbound parameters) and it goes by the basic order type, with the receiver port B2B_P2P for procurement where B2B is a middleware. During the run, the program selects all un-dispatched PO-related EDI IDocs, convert them to cXML format, and then dispatch them over internet to suppliers.
</p>

<h1>PTP-FS-INT-010 - Dispatch PO to Suppliers via Email and Fax   </h1>

<p>
Genentech Inc. has a custom PO Output Type ZNEU. The POs are emailed to suppliers with the PO form and attachments converted to PDF format. Connection with a mail server must be setup and maintained. 
</p>

<p>
Similarly, for POs that are to be faxed to the supplier, the PO form must be dispatched first and the attachments should be faxed with the same output. Connection with a fax server must be setup and maintained.
